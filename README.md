# Pistachio-Image-Denoising-using-Autoencoders_Deep-Learning

This project focused on restoring noisy pistachio images using deep learningâ€“based denoising autoencoders. The goal was to reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs, improving visual quality and preserving structural details for better image clarity and feature extraction.

**Tools**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib

**Approach**: Compared three architectures: a baseline autoencoder, a U-Net model, and a tuned U-Net with optimized hyperparameters using GridSearch.

**Results**: The Tuned U-Net achieved the lowest MSE (0.000230), lowest MAE (0.006506), and highest reconstruction accuracy, outperforming the baseline and standard U-Net.

**Key Insight**: Careful hyperparameter tuning can significantly improve image reconstruction quality, even when using similar model architectures.
